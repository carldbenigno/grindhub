# GrindHub 🚀

Hey! 👋 Welcome to **GrindHub** – my personal web app designed to keep me organized during my job hunt and while I chase my goals. It’s a **job tracker, to-do list, and habit tracker** all in one place, helping me stay productive and motivated. 💪

## Features
- **Job Tracker**: Keep track of all my job applications, from "Applied" to "Interview" and beyond.  
- **To-Do List**: Stay on top of my tasks and check them off daily.  
- **Habit Tracker**: Track my daily habits and see my progress.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS  
- **Backend**: Supabase (Database & Authentication)

## Why GrindHub?
I'm building this app because I need something **simple and functional** to track my job applications and personal progress. Plus, it’s a **great project** to showcase my skills and hopefully land my next dev role. 👨‍💻
